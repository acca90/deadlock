                <h5>Deadlock Problem</h5>
                <p>In computer science according to Tenanbaum, there is a problem known as DeadLock.
                    “A conjunct of process will be in a Deadlock situation if all process that is from a conjunct are waiting for an event that only another process that is from the same conjunct could do,
                    but as it is locked waiting the event, that event will never occur because the process will only generate the event when the other process finish.”
                For that to happen there is some conditions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mutual Exclusion: every resource is either associated with a single process or available;</li>
                    <li>Possession and Waiting: processes that hold resources can request new resources;</li>
                    <li>No Preemption: resources previously granted cannot be taken;</li>
                    <li>Circular wait: there must be a circular chain of two or more processes, in which each is waiting for resources retained by the next member of that chain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A Deadlock that can happen physically is on the traffic, this occurs when the vehicles block the passage of others waiting for their moment to continue,
                    but so do they, locking the traffic in every way. In the animation the deadlock will happen, demonstrating in a more direct way what is a Deadlock</p>
                <p>Understanding this context, the animation is going to show both cases, when it starts in the first moment the traffic is going to work properly,
                    exemplifying a good program that has no problems.  When the button is pushed a second animation will occur, showing the example of a Deadlock on the traffic.</p>
